# Overview
This is a general online store. Whereby, you can create your own Store, add items to it, review other peoples items. This project uses Google OAuth 2.0 for logging / creating your account. Whenever you buy an item, the owner will be notified about your need for that item.

The FrontEnd and backend are seperated. So they both run on the same IP address but the ports are different. In order to optimize the integration process. The FrontEnd runs at PORT 3000 and the Backend runs at PORT 5000. *You can change the backend port in the config.env file.*

# API's
Basically, on the backend side there are 12 routes.

__Admin Routes are:__

* [GET, DELETE] /api/users: For all the users
* [GET, POST, DELETE] /api/store: For all the stores
* [GET, POST, DELETE] /api/items: For all the Items
* [GET, POST, DELETE] /api/reviews: For all the reviews
